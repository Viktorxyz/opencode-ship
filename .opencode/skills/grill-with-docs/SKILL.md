Run a `/grilling` session, using the `/domain-modeling` skill.

## Ship integration

This skill is part of the engineering profile shipped by
`opencode-ship@1.0`. The strong planner child session is
configured with `openai/gpt-5.6-sol` and the durable workflow
state lives under `<git-common-dir>/opencode-ship/`. All
GitHub mutations go through Ship's typed tools; never use
`gh api` or raw shell.
